The nitinol material will be metal 3D printed in various formats and tested. The core structure design will be optimised for achieving a combination of high strength and high latent heat capacity and release rate. This will provide a basis for the heat pump system enhancement. The design freedom of metal AM will thereby be investigated to allow for improved heat exchange efficiency and robustness.. . In this role, a rig to control the stress level on the core and the temperature of the core, will be implemented. Sensors to record strain, temperature, stress and displacement will be used to characterise the material response, the efficiency of the system, and to enhance the process control.. Show more"

"Cork, County Cork, Ireland","The Marine Geosciences Research Group, School of Biological, Earth & Environmental Science, University College Cork, are seeking a motivated Post-Doctoral Researcher to join the I-MORE project. The successful candidate will be based at UCC in the Marine Geosciences Research Group and will work closely with industry partners (Gavin & Doherty Geosolutions) as well as academics and researchers in partner institutions (SFI Centre for Research in Applied Geosciences (iCRAG) and the SFI Research Centre for Energy, Climate and Marine (MaREI)).. . Offshore wind energy is rapidly coming of age, with European offshore wind output at the end of 2020 at approximately 25 GW. In parallel with the increased volume of offshore energy, there has been a dramatic reduction in the Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE) for recent European projects. However, despite offshore wind gaining global traction and Ireland being one of the earliest movers of this technology when the Arklow Bank Phase 1 wind farm was commissioned in 2004, Ireland are now significantly behind the curve with respect to global offshore wind markets.. . The I-MORE project is a multi-disciplinary project involving industry, academic and state partners that will act as a pilot study to demonstrate the potential for early stage national survey campaigns to provide baseline data to inform marine spatial planning and optimised offshore wind developments. The project will focus on gathering early stage site information with respect to geological, geophysical, geotechnical and metocean conditions to allow a holistic view of an offshore zone/site to be determined. The project will initially target a number of key sites for site investigation using advanced geotechnical methods. Initially, existing geophysical and geological datasets (e.g. INFOMAR) will be analysed, interpreted, and developed into a set of ground models to inform shallow ground conditions and assist with site identification. Following site data collection, the geotechnical data will be integrated with the legacy geophysical data to develop a new geotechno-stratigraphic framework and classification for Irish specific seabed conditions. This map output can be used to inform the potential for offshore wind energy through a combined suitability, constraint and hazard analysis with regard to marine spatial planning.. . Scope: the Post Doc will drive Work Package 2 of I-MORE (Pilot Site Identification).. . The aim of this WP is to conduct a desktop study to identify potential sites for surveying during WP3 by establishing a national constraint map pertinent to the overall objects of the I-MORE project (i.e. select sites and characterise); produce a stakeholder engagement roadmap; hold a stakeholder workshop; and produce optimal site listing and characterisation report. By the end of this WP, the I-MORE project will have identified the preferred, optimal sites to survey for the next phase of the project; characterised thee sites by an initial ground model using available geological and geophysical data; and identified and engaged with all major stakeholders on the project.. . . A PhD qualification in seabed mapping, marine geology or GIS/geomorphology. (essential). Extensive competence and experience the research area e.g. GIS (spatial analyses), ground model development and/or marine geoscience (essential).
